At Houndstooth we can't stress enough that "if you’re not testing, you’re just guessing".  This seems like a very simple and probably obvious saying, yet it constantly seems to get over-looked.  Every marketer feels like they "know" the best way to do something.  I constantly say, "I would imagine that if we did X, then Y will happen, but without looking at the data and testing the hypothesis, I can’t give a concrete answer".  

Marketing and Sales, I believe, is 50% intrinsic and 50% science.  If you do not have a solid process in place to test hypotheses, then you can never really come to a general theory for your services.  I would suggest evaluating if you do things such as design, develop and strategize with **intention** as opposed to just because, which seems to be the case over and over.  This is a good, short article explaining that very concept.  While we don’t know if the author actually experienced a growth in sales by any means, we do know that making such a bold, albeit silly statement had a significant impact on pre-conceived notions.
