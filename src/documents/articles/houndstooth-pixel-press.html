<p>So recently Houndstooth partnered with <a href="http://pixelpressgame.com">Pixel Press</a> to build an entirely new platform for video game creation. The project is currently on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robinrath/pixel-press-draw-your-own-video-game">Kickstarter</a> to gain public funding. I'll be posting updates, images and videos on this blog as the project progresses.</p>

<p>Below are some images that I've snapped during the process, it's been a lot of fun thus far.</p>
