<p>There has never been anything I have read, seen or heard that I have connected with and agreed with more than this speech by Dave Grohl. If you want any type of glimpse into how I think, watch this video. If that doesn't matter to you, watch it anyway. I literally put my fists in the air, by myself, with my headphones on, multiple times throughout. It's that kind of speech that makes you want to plug your guitar in and crank it as loud as it will go and just scream rock and roll.</p>
