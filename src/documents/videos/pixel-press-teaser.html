<p>A project I am involved with that I thoroughly enjoy, <a href="http://pixelpressgame.com" title="Pixel Press">Pixel Press</a> is a video game creation platform based on drawing. A lot of potential here for early game development education. You can even see a re-arranged Houndstooth office in the video.</p>
